### floating point (float) (4 byte)
Used for computer graphics. Way of representing 2/5, 1.234, 9.9999, pi number . . .\
Similar to scientific notation.\

### double (double floating point) (8)
Represent non-integer. Used for computer graphics, more precised than float but takes more memory.

* unsigned      Apply to char, short, int and long, means than it cannot have negative values



### Pointers

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
	int a = 5;	// declaring an integer variable and assigning the value of 5
	int *ptr;	// declaring a pointer to integer
	int b;		// declaring an integer variable
    printf("ptr's value: %2d, ptr's address: %p\n\n", *ptr, ptr);

	ptr = &a;	// pointer ptr points to what is stored at the memory address of variable a
	b = a;		// b will take the value and not the address
	a = 42;		// b is still equal to 5, but ptr will return 42, which is the value now stored at a's location;
	printf("  a's value: %2d,   a's address: %p\n", a, &a);
	printf("ptr's value: %2d, ptr's address: %p\n", *ptr, ptr); // you will get the same as above, notice that you have to dereference the pointer with * to get the value, and using the pointer alone (ptr) will give you the memory address.
	printf("  b's value: %2d,   b's address: %p\n", b, &b);
	//printf("Size of ptr: %zu\n", sizeof(ptr)); // size of ptr in bytes, 8 on my system.
	return 0;
}
```

You will get this kind of output:
```
ptr's value:  1, ptr's address: 0x7ffd99493000

  a's value: 42,   a's address: 0x7ffd99492f08
ptr's value: 42, ptr's address: 0x7ffd99492f08  <-- they now match thanks to ptr = &a
  b's value:  5,   b's address: 0x7ffd99492f0c
```

**NB: On the second printf you will get the value that you got for `a`, notice that you have to dereference the pointer with * to get the value, and using the pointer alone (ptr) will give you the memory address.**


#### [About Endianness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness).

Values are stored differently depending on the kind of system you are using.

Little endian means that the value is stored in memory from left to right, big endian means it is stored from right to left.

*[See this example with int a = 9](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12791864/c-program-to-check-little-vs-big-endian/12792301#12792301):*

```
little endian: 

       higher memory
          ----->
    +----+----+----+----+
    |0x09|0x00|0x00|0x00|
    +----+----+----+----+
    |
   &x = 0xff


big endian:
    +----+----+----+----+
    |0x00|0x00|0x00|0x09|
    +----+----+----+----+
    |
   &x
```

*To find out if your system is big or little endian you can use the [following function](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4181951/how-to-check-whether-a-system-is-big-endian-or-little-endian/4181991):*
```c
int x = 9;

if (*(char *)&x == 0x09) // we cast x as a byte to get its very first byte, it will return true (meaning little endian) if the first byte is equal to 9.
```
Next you should **study the different concepts in programming**, especially spend time understanding the different [C data types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_data_types), [the concept of pointers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_(computer_programming)) and [arrays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_type), because it is what you have been using up to now and it will only get more complicated.

## 0x06 ~ Impossible is not C

### Negative index Array

```c
#include <limits.h>	// INT_MAX
#include <stdio.h>	// printf

int main(void) {
	int x[2001];
	int *y = &x[1000];

	(void)x;
	y[-10] = 5;
	printf("%d\n", y[-10]);
}
```

### It's just a pointer game

Did you know ? Instead of writing array[index], you can write index[array]:
```c
int ft_strlen(char *str) {
	int i = 0;
	while (i[str])
		++i;

	return i;
}
```

Because this is understood by the compiler as pointer arithmetic:
```c
int ft_strlen(char *str) {
	int i = 0;
	while (*(str+i))
		++i;

	return i;
}
```

### Get function name, filename or even line number

```__FILE__```, ```__FUNCTION__``` and ```__LINE__``` macros can be very helpful to display meaningful error messages for both users and developers:

```c
#include <stdbool.h>	// bool
#include <unistd.h>		// write
#include <stdlib.h>		// malloc
#include <string.h>		// strlen
#include <stdarg.h>		// va_list

bool	ft_error_va(char *errmsg, ...) {
	va_list		args;
	char		*arg = errmsg;

	write(2, errmsg, strlen(errmsg));
	va_start(args, errmsg);
	while (arg = va_arg(args, char*)) {
		write(2, arg, strlen(arg));
	}
	write(2, "\n", 1);
	va_end(args);
	return false;
}

char	*ft_itoa(int n);

bool	ft_error(char *errmsg, char *file, const char *function, int line) {
	 return ft_error_va(errmsg, "File: ", __FILE__,  ", in function ", \
	 (char *)function, ", line ", ft_itoa(line), NULL);
}


bool	dummy_function(void) {
	 if (3 != 2)
	 	return ft_error("Error with 3 != 2: ", __FILE__, __FUNCTION__, __LINE__);
}

int			main(void) {
	if (!dummy_function())
		return 1;
	return 0;
}

char	*ft_itoa(int n)
{
	char	*s;
	long	tmp;
	int		length;

	tmp = n;
	length = (n <= 0 ? 2 : 1);
	while (n && ++length)
		n /= 10;
	if (!(s = (char *)malloc(sizeof(char) * length)))
		return (NULL);
	s[--length] = '\0';
	if (tmp <= 0)
		s[0] = (tmp < 0 ? '-' : '0');
	while (tmp)
	{
		s[--length] = (tmp < 0 ? -tmp : tmp) % 10 + '0';
		tmp /= 10;
	}
	return (s);
}
```
If you don't know what variadic functions are, ```#include <stdarg.h>```, you can check [my implementation of printf](https://github.com/agavrel/42-ft_printf/blob/master/srcs/ft_printf.c)

### Setting values of a struct to 0 without using memset or bzero

You can use either:
```c
t_mystruct mystruct = {};
```

or, to comply with 42 Norminette that forbid declaration and assignation on the same row:
```c
t_mystruct mystruct;
mystruct = (t_mystruct){};
```

# :fire: Common Beginner Mistakes

> **Experience is the name everyone gives to their mistakes** – *[Oscar Wilde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Picture_of_Dorian_Gray)*

---
## 0x00 ~ Array overflow

In C the index of an array starts at 0. Because C does not perform boundary checking when using arrays, if you access outside the bounds of a stack based array it will just access another part of already allocated stack space, like in this example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void    somefunction3(void)
{
    int a[5] = {1,3,5,7,9};
    printf("%d\n", a[5]);
}
```
In this example, 5 is the size of the array and if you try to access it it will overflow. Remember that the maximum array index you can ever access is its size minus 1.

I would suggest to use as much as possible a const :
```c
#include <stdio.h>

void    somefunction3(void)
{
	const int len = 5;
	int a[len] = {1,3,5,7,9};
	for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) // safe
		printf("%d\n", a[i]);
}
```

---
## 0x01 ~ Segmentation Fault

> **There are two ways to write error-free programs; only the third one works** – *Alan J. Perlis*

*Many potential reasons for this...*


---
## Loop segfault
One common mistake is that you had declared a loop and either:

#### Forgot to increment the counter

```c
int i = 0;

while (i < 10)
{
	write(1, &i + '0', 1);
	// but where is i++ ?
}
```

#### Correct way

```c
int i = 0;

while (i < 10)
{
	write(1, &i + '0', 1);
    	i++;
}
```

### Forgot the exit condition:

```c
int somevariable = 0;
while (42) // always True ! You will be 42 for life ;)
{
    // call to some stuff that never succeed to set someVariable to 1;
    if (somevariable == 1) // make sure that somevariable will equal 1 at some point.
        break ;
}
```

### Used an assignation = instead of a boolean expression != == <= >=

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
	unsigned int x = 10;

	while (--x != 0)
	{
		printf("0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 ");
		if (x = 1) {			// oopsie !!
			printf("* ");
			x--;
		}
	}
	return 0;
}
```
*PS: will you be able to fix this code ?*  

Also classic with lists:  you have a loop and its crucial condition that allows the function to return, but used an assignation instead of comparison
```c
int i = 0;

while (list)
{
    if (list = NULL) // You want to use if (list == NULL)
        return i;
    i++;
    list=list->next;
}
return -1; // will always return -1
```

### Quizz: What will print this loop ?

```c
unsigned char c = 0;

while (c < 150)
{
	write(1, &c, 1);
	c++;
}
```

> **Talk is cheap. Show me the code** ― *Linus Torvalds*


### Accessing the next link in a chained-list without checking the current one

Another example with linked-lists
```c
typedef struct  s_list {
      void      *data;
      t_list    *next;
 }              t_list;

/*
** function to go 2 links further in a chained-list
*/

void somefunction(t_list *list)
{
    if (list->next != NULL)
    {
        list = list->next->next;
    }
}
```

if the current link of list is null you will get a segfault. The correct way is to always check the current link before the next one:
```c
void somefunction(t_list *list)
{
    if (list && list->next) // if both list and list->next exist
        list = list->next->next;
}
```

### Accessing an index in a loop for program with either graphics or a board game
```c
int somefunction(int y_max, int x_max, int array[y_max][x_max]);
{
    int y;
    int x;

    y  = 0;
    while (y < y_max)
    {
        x = 0;
        while (x < x_max)
        {
            if (array[y][x-1] > array[y][x]) // don't you see there is a problem ?
                array[y][x] = array[y][x-1];
            if (array[y+1][x] > array[y][x]) // don't you see there is another problem ?
                array[y][x] = array[y+1][x];
        }

    }
}
```

These lines should be corrected the following way:
```c
if (x > 0 && array[y][x-1] > array[y][x])
if (y < y_max - 1 && array[y+1][x] > array[y][x]) // strictly inferior to last possible index which is y_max - 1,
// you may also write y <= y_max - 2
```

You may also notice that we can even do better by changing the starting value of x or the exit condition of the y loop **in the case that we were to check only one of the two if conditions.**
```c
x = 1;
while (y < y_max - 1)
```

Another example
```c
int main(void) {
	const int x_max = 3;
	const int y_max = 3;
	int a[y_max][x_max];
	
	for (int y = 0; y < y_max; y++)
    	for (int x = 0; x < x_max; x++)
			a[y+6][x] = x + y;
}
```

---
## 0x02 ~ Bus error

Occur when your processor cannot even attempt the memory access requested, like trying to access an address that does not satisfy its alignment requirements.
```c
int main(void) {
	const int x_max = 3;
	const int y_max = 3;
	int a[y_max][x_max];
	
	for (int y = 0; y < y_max; y++)
    	for (int x = 0; x < x_max; x++)
			a[y][x] = a[x] + a[y];
}
```


---
## 0x03 ~ Stack smashing

See below in the recommended books the one by Aleph One, how you can make use of such "error"
```c
int main(void) {
	const int x_max = 3;
	const int y_max = 3;
	int a[y_max][x_max];
	
	for (int y = 0; y < y_max; y++)
    	for (int x = 0; x < x_max; x++)
        	a[y][x] = x + y;

	for (int y = 0; y < y_max; y++) {
    	for (int x = 0; x < x_max; x++) {
        	a[y+6][x] += a[y][x];
    	}
	}
}
```

---
## 0x04 ~ Modifying value of a local variable given as function parameter

Local variable value are allocated on the stack, which is cleaned once you exit the function.

### Useless variable change

```c
void increment_a(int a)
{
    a++; // it will have no effect
}

int solve(void)
{
    int a = 5;

    increment_a(a);
}
```

### Useful variable change

Hence if you want to modify a value you either have to use a pointer to the memory address:
```c
void increment_a(int *a)
{
    *a++;
}

int solve(void)
{
    int a = 5;

    increment_a(&a);
}
```

or return the local value:
```c
int increment_a(int a)
{
    return a + 1;
}

int solve(void)
{
    int a = 5;

    a = increment_a(a);
}
```

## 0x05 ~ Unprotected malloc

Do NOT leave a malloc unprotected:
```c
int allocate_memory(void)
{
    int *matrix;

    matrix = malloc(sizeof(int) * 9))

    return matrix;
}

int somefunction(void)
{
	int *matrix;

	matrix = allocate_memory();
}
```

Protect both the malloc **and its return value**:
It is not good enough to protect the malloc in the callee function (the function called) if the returned value is not also protected in the caller function (the function 'above')
```c
int allocate_memory(void)
{
	int *matrix;

	if (!(matrix = malloc(sizeof(int) * 9))) // this is short for matrix = malloc(sizeof(int) * 9; if (matrix == NULL)
		return NULL;   // the malloc is now protected,

	return matrix;
}

int somefunction(void)
{
	int *matrix;

	if ((matrix = allocate_memory()) == NULL) // the return value is also protected
        	exit(); // note that often you can't or don't want to use exit() and will need to return 0 along all the functions up to the main function.
	free(matrix);
}
```

---
## 0x06 ~ Freeing memory that has already been fred

In the previous example, if you don't need the variable matrix anymore you can free it.  

However do not attempt to free twice or to free a stack based variable:
```c
int main(void) {
	int *matrix;

	if (!(matrix = malloc(sizeof(int) * 9)))
		return 1; // NB: exceptionnally return 1 in the main, it means that an error occured
	free(matrix); // OK
	free(matrix) // Not OK

	return 0; // return 0, the program run without error
}
```


---
## 0x07 ~ Do Not use global variables

> "Theory and practice sometimes clash. And when that happens, theory loses.  
Every single time." ― Linus Torvalds

Global variables are forbidden in 42 School except for a few exceptions, see this interesting article: [Are Global Variables Bad](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/484635/are-global-variables-bad)
However many students, me including, found a way to circumvent this interdiction: you first declare a structure in the header that will contain all our variables:

> "Don’t comment bad code—rewrite it." ― *Brian W. Kernighan, The Elements of Programming Style*

```c
typedef struct s_env
{
    int a;
    int b;
    int c[4];
    // ... other variables you may need
}           t_env;
```
And then using it the following way in the program:
```c
void somefunction2(t_env *env)
{
    env->b = 2;
}

void somefunction(t_env *env)
{
    env->a = 1;

    somefunction2(env);
}

int main(void)
{
    t_env env;

    somefunction(&env);

    printf("%d\n", env.a);
    printf("%d\n", env.b);
}
```

This is "legal" in 42 (it is not a global variable, it is a structure passed along functions), it "works", but it is a very poor architecture choice. It is okay for beginner to do this but as your skill grows you should find more clever ways to architecture your programs.


---
## 0x08 ~ Variable Length Arrays

[Waiter! There's a VLA in my C!](http://ayekat.ch/blog/vla)

The following example is a VLA and this is bad for many reasons, the most critical being that the memory is allocated on the stack which has a limited size.
```c
int somefunction(int y, int x, int array[y][x]);
```
My peer reviewer: "wow [your filler](https://github.com/agavrel/42-filler) run so fast!"
Me: "really ?" (how to tell them that it was not compliant with the norm? :D)

---
## 0x09 ~ Using ft_ prefix for all functions

*ft_* should only be added to functions you want to re-use through different projects (and add to your personal library, the libft project) not for specific program functions.


---
## 0x0A ~ [Usage of Sequence Point](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_point)
```c
#include <unistd.h>

int main()
{
	int i = 0; 
	i = (i++);
	write(1, &i + '0', 1);

	return 0;
}
```
Guess what will be printed.


---
## 0x0B ~ Assignment of read-only location
```c
int main()
{
	const char s[20] = "hello world";
	*s = 'a';
	s[0] = 'b';

	return 0;
}
```

You cannot change what you have declared as const.

## OXOC ~ Carefully use define preprocessor macros

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define MAX(a,b)	a > b ? a : b

int main(void) {
	int a = 5;
	int b = 42;
	int c = 40 +  MAX(a,b);
	
	printf("%d\n", c);
	return 0;
}
```

This will return 5, becaure the compiler understand it as :
```c
int main(void) {
	int a = 5;
	int b = 42;
	int c = 40 + 5 > 42 ? 5 : 42; // if 47 > 42 then c = a (5) , else c = b (42);
	...
}
```

The correct usage is to always encapsulate your ```#define``` with brackets to make sure it works as intended:
```c
#define MAX(a,b)	(a > b ? a : b)
```

That said you should avoid using macros who act like functions in the first place. Also note that you should always capitalize macro names and const variables, it is a convention.

## 0x0D ~ Comparing float and double

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
	double d = 1.1;
	float f = 1.1;

	if (f != d)
		puts("float and double are different\n");
	if (f != 1.1)
		puts("Do not compare a float to an integer value\n");
	if (d == 1.1)
		puts("But that's okay for a double\n");
	if (f == 1.1f)  // note the extra 'f' at the end
		puts("This is how you compare a float to a float value\n");

	return 0;
}
```

They are represented differently. If you want to learn more about how they work take a look at [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format) or wach below video.

## 0x0E ~ Wrong usage of pointers

Pointers are the memory location of the value of this variable

An example with ft_swap

### The wrong way to use pointers
```c
void ft_swap(int *a, int *b)
{
	int *tmp;

	*tmp = *a;
	*a = *b;
	*b = *tmp;
}
```

This will segfault, because you declared tmp as a pointer, but what you want is tmp to store the value of the memory address of a.

### The correct way to use pointers
```c
void ft_swap(int *a, int *b)
{
	int tmp;

	tmp = *a;
	*a = *b;
	*b = tmp;
}
```

### Swapping without using another variable
```c
=void ft_swap(int *a, int *b)
{
	*a ^= *b;		// (1) a = a ^ b
	*b ^= *a;		// (2) b = b ^ (a ^ b) = a
	*a ^= *b;		// (3) a = (a ^ b) ^ a  = b  // a was set to a^b (1) and b became a (2)
	
}
```
**NB: if you xor a number by itself you set it to 0. ```a ^= a;``` is equivalent to ```a = 0;```**  
*If you like it you can [learn more about bitwise operations here](https://github.com/agavrel/42-Bitwise_Operators)*

### Main to test above functions
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
	int a = 5;
	int b = 42;

	printf("a: %d \t b: %d\n", a, b);
	ft_swap(&a, &b);
	printf("a: %d \t b: %d\n", a, b);
	return 0;
}
```

## 0x0F ~ Undefined Behavior

Undefined behavior means that the result is **as much unpredictable as a [pangolin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangolin) sneezing in some faraway country**. *You don't want to have your program depending on it.*

```c
#include <stdio.h>

char omg(char i) {
return ++i + ++i + ++i + ++i + ++i + ++i + ++i \
 	+ ++i + ++i + ++i + ++i + ++i + ++i + ++i \
 	+ ++i + ++i + ++i + ++i + ++i + ++i + ++i \
 	+ ++i + ++i + ++i + ++i + ++i + ++i + ++i \
 	+ ++i + ++i + ++i + ++i + ++i + ++i + ++i \
 	+ ++i + ++i + ++i + ++i + ++i + ++i + ++i \
 	+ ++i + ++i + ++i + ++i + ++i + ++i + ++i \
 	+ ++i + ++i + ++i + ++i + ++i + ++i -5;
}


int main(int argc, char **argv) {
	unsigned char i = omg(i);

	if (i++ > 254)
		printf("%d\n", ++i);
}
```
*Try guessing the output*


---
## 0x10 ~ Operator Precedence

Often you may write some code like:
```c
return !(a & b << 8);
```

This is bad because you ignore the rule of operator precedences, and should have written the return as:
```c
return !(a & (b << 8));
```

Another example with pointers:
```c
*s->a++;
(*s)->a++;
(*s->a)++;
```

Below you will find the full table of [operator precedence](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/operator_precedence):

Precedence | Operator | Description | Associativity
---|---|---|---
1|++ --|	Suffix/postfix increment and decrement|Left-to-right

## Conclusion: Condensed version of mistakes that still compile

A full example of a program compiling but that will not work as intended:

```c
#include <stdio.h> // notably for printf
#include <stdlib.h> // notably for malloc

void increment(int n);
int *create_and_print_int_array(int len);

int main(void) {

/* float and double are different */
    float f = 1.54321; // should be 1.54321f to assign a float value
    double d = 1.54321;
    if (f == d) // float and double are represented differently
        printf("true");


/* always initialize your variables */
    int i;
    printf("%d\n", i); // by default C value are not initialized to 0;


/* changing a variable value */
    i = 2; // you can set a variable value with an assignation
    increment(i); // either give the variable's address by passing the pointer, or returning a new value from the function.
    i++;
    printf("%f\n", i); // use printf with the correct format specifier, f is for double and float, while d is for integers.
    printf("%d\n", i); // that's much better


/* know the range of each type */
    char c = 'a';
    while (c < 150) // what is c type? what is c type's max value?
        c++;

    int n = -2147483648; // INT_MIN value;
    n = -n; // should print 2147483648 right?
    printf("%d\n", n);

    unsigned int m = 0xffffffff; // unsigned int max value is easily represented with 8 'f' (2 'f' = 1 byte)
    unsigned int l = (1 << 32) - 1; // will overflow, you have to write (1UL << 32)
    printf("m: %u\nl: %u\n", m, l);

    n = 0;
    while (--n) // not as secured as writing while (--n >= 0)
        printf("%d\n", n);

    m = 5;
    while (m --> -1) // will always be true as unsigned are always equal to 0 or superior
        printf("%d\n", m); // should be %u for unsigned

/* about using malloc */
    int *arr;
    arr = create_and_print_int_array(5);


/* about using correctly scanf */
    int a;
    scanf("%d", a); // scanf takes a pointer, you have to add &
}

// wrong way to change a variable's value:
void increment(int n) {
    n += 1; // the local value of n is modified, also it can be written as ++n; or n++;
}

// correct ways to change a variable's value:
void increment_using_ptr(int *i) { // increment_using_ptr(&i);
    *i++;
}

int increment_using_return(int i) { // i = increment_using_return(i);
    return i + 1;
}

// malloc correctly and protect it
int *create_int_array(int len) {
    int *n;
    n = (int *)malloc(len); // there are three things wrong:
    // 1: there is no need to cast the result of malloc
    // 2: you should actually malloc sizeof(int) * len, as you give to malloc a number of bytes to malloc, but integer is stored on 4 bytes
    // 3: malloc can fail, so it should be protected:
    /*if (n == NULL)
        return NULL;*/
    return n;
}

int *create_and_print_int_array(int len) {
    int *n = create_int_array(len); // if the memory allocation from the subfunction fails, no protection, should add if (n == NULL) below
    /*if (n == NULL)
        return NULL;*/
    n[5] = 5; // n[5] is equivalent to *(n + 5), problem: we have only (intended to) malloc 5 items, not 6.
    for (int i = 0; i <= len; i++) // index rightfully starts at 0 but should end at len - 1. Also sizeof(n) is not equivalent to len.
        printf("%d ", n[i]); // it can still work but it is undefined behavior.
    printf("\n");
    return n;
}
```

## 0x00 ~ Meaningful and Explicit Names

> "The best programs are written so that computing machines can perform them quickly and so that human beings can understand them clearly." - 
Donald Ervin Knuth

I once met a developer who was using hp and mp instead of x and y for coordinates.  
While being a very good reference to [JRPG]()... it is totally out of question to code like this.
The function name should always be:
* In English, forget about chauvinism!
* At least 5 letters. It is okay to have shorter exceptionally for well-known variables like int index -> int i, temporary -> tmp and pointer -> ptr.
* Self-explanatory: build_graph instead of graph or build_it
* For long name use either camel case (saveClientConfig) or snake case (save_client_config) and stick to one style.

### Writing a function check if a file exist

```c
#include <sys/stat.h>	// stat
#include <stdbool.h> 	// bool type
#include <stdio.h>		// printf

bool	file_exist (char *filename)	// Always use bool for Manichean functions
{
  struct stat   buffer;

  return !stat(filename, &buffer);
}

int		main(int ac, char **av) {
	if (ac != 2)
		return 1;

	if (file_exist("a.out"))
		printf("%s exists\n", av[1]);
	else
		printf("%s does not exist\n", av[1]);

	return 0;
}
```

## 0x01 ~ Write short functions

> "FUNCTIONS SHOULD DO ONE THING. THEY SHOULD DO IT WELL. THEY SHOULD DO IT ONLY." ― *Robert C. Martin in Clean Code (p35)*

**42 has a rigid but fair rule: limits every functions to 25 lines.**  

*Let's see a case study with a function to get lower case (from 'A' to 'a') for a given character*

**0b001 Function done by a 42 'Piscineux' (AKA it works):**
```c
char	to_lower_by_piscineux(char c) {
	if (c >= 'A' && c <= 'Z')
		return c - 'A' + 'a';
	else if (c >= 'a' && c <= 'a')	// useless else if, since both else if and else return the same value
		return c;
	else
		return c;
}
```

**0b010 Good 42 Student who read GNU C library's tolower's man and read ```int tolower(int c)``` (prototype):**
```c
int		to_lower_by_student(int c) {
	if (c >= 'A' && c <= 'Z')
		return c - 'A' + 'a';
	else			// NB: Don't keep this extra "else" as there is no code executed after the return statement
		return c;
}
```

**0b011 However you could save memory by using only 1 byte (char) instead of 4 (int) since ASCII values range from 0 to 127 as demonstrated by Steve Maguire in "Writing Solid Code" (p101):**
```c
char	to_lower_by_smaguire(char c) {
	if (c >= 'A' && c <= 'Z')
		return (c + 'a' - 'A');
	return (c);
}
```

**0b100 My own version: [making use of the ASCII table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) and apply the Do Only One Thing principle:**
```c
#include <stdbool.h>    // bool type

bool	is_upper_case(int c) {
	return ((unsigned int)(c - 'A') <= ('Z' - 'A'));
}

int		to_lower_by_agavrel(int c) {		// Check ASCII table and you will notice a nice pattern
	return is_upper_case(c) ? c | 0b100000 : c;
}
```

**0b101 You may try above functions with the following main program:**
```c
#include <unistd.h>		// write syscall

void	putchar_endl(char c) {	// NB: endl stands for endline, '\n'
	write(1, &c, 1);
	write(1, "\n", 1);
}

#include <ctype.h> 		// GNU C Library tolower

int		main(int ac, char **av) {
	if (ac != 2)
		return 1;

	unsigned char c = *av[1];
	putchar_endl(tolower(c));
	putchar_endl(to_lower_by_piscineux(c));
	putchar_endl(to_lower_by_student(c));
	putchar_endl(to_lower_by_smaguire(c));
	putchar_endl(to_lower_by_agavrel(c));

	return 0;
}
```

**0b110 Have you tried [one step closer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSUsBpdugX0) to the bytecode  ?**
```c
int		to_lower_assembly(int c) {
	__asm__ __volatile__ (R"(
	.intel_syntax noprefix
		mov     eax, %0
        lea		edx, [eax - ('A')]
		or      %0, 0b100000
		cmp		edx, 'Z'-'A'
        cmovb	eax, %0		
	.att_syntax noprefix)"
	:[c]"=r" (c)
	:: "memory");
}
```

## 0x02 ~ Using structure for basic items

If you are using coordinates it might be interesting to create a structure 'point' or 'coord'

```c
typedef struct s_point
{
    int y;
    int x;
}           t_point;

void somefunction(void){
    t_point p;

    p.x = 2;
    p.y = 5;

    //alternatively:  p = {5, 2};
}
```


---
## 0x03 ~ Using flags for projects' options

For each project you will often have to parse flag input. In Linux the flag usually come after a '-' and allow for extra functionalities.
It is quite useful know how to store such critical information into only 4 bytes *which is sizeof(integer)*

```c
static int	ft_strchr_index(char *s, int c)
{
	int		i;

	i = 0;
	while (s[i])
	{
		if (s[i] == c)
			return (i);
		++i;
	}
	return (-1);
}

int			get_flags(char *s, int *flags)
{
	int		n;

	while (*(++s))
	{
		if ((n = ft_strchr_index("alRrtdG1Ss", *s)) == -1)
			return (0);
		*flags |= (1 << n);
	}
	return (1);
}

int			main(int ac, char **av)
{
	int	i;

	int flags = 0;
	i = 0;
	while (++i < ac && av[i][0] == '-' && av[i][1])
	{
		if (av[i][1] == '-' && av[i][2])
			return (i + 1);
		if (!get_flags(av[i], &flags))
			return (-1);
	}
	return (i);
}
```

The 'a' flag will be on bit 1, 'l' on bit 2, 'R' on bit 4, 'r' on bit 8 etc.
You can then test if the flag was on by using the following:
```c
#define FLAG_A  0b001
#define FLAG_L  0b010
#define FLAG_RR 0b100

#include <stdio.h>

void    somefunction(int *flags)
{
	if (flags & FLAG_A)
		printf("Flag a is set!\n");    
}
```

*NB: Be very cautious as & and | have lower precedence than relational operators:*
```c
if (flags & FLAG_L == MASK) // equivalent to (flags & (FLAG_L == MASK))
```

*Correct example:*
```c
if ((flags & FLAG_L) == MASK)
```

You can unset a flag by clearing the corresponding bit the following way:
```c
void    somefunction2(int *flags)
{
	flags &= ~FLAG_A;
}
```

> **Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live** – *John Woods*

An even more readable and better approach is to declare a struct using bitfield:

```c
struct 	flags_t
{
	int a : 1;
	int b : 1;
	int c : 1;
	//etc
}

#include <unistd.h>

int	main(void) {
	struct flags_t flags = {0};
	t.a = 1;
	if (t.a)
		write(1, "flag a is set\n", 14);
	return 0;
}
```
PS: Of course rename flags' name with more meaningful ones.

## 0x05 ~ Using preprocessor DEBUG macros

> **Everyone knows that debugging is twice as hard as writing a program in the first place. So if you're as clever as you can be when you write it, how will you ever debug it?** ― *Brian W. Kernighan*

You can improve the performance of your program by using what we call preprocessor macros
```c
#include <unistd.h>

#define DEBUG true

int main(void) {
	if (DEBUG)
		write(1, 42, 1);
	return 0;
}
```
As a convention name should be capitalized with '_' to join words

---
## 0x06 ~ Branching Optimization

Often you will test that a specific value is reached or that a variable is set using if condition. But the order of the comparisons can improve efficiency of your program.  

What would be wrong with the below function?
```c

int counter_to_star(int a, int b) {
	while (42) {
		if (((a + b) & 1) && a == 42) {
			break;
		}
		a |= 1;
		a *= b;
		a %= 60;
		b++;
		n++;
	}

	return n;
}
```

What is wrong is that the most unlikely condition ```a == 42``` is tested last, while it should be tested first. The most likely condition, that a + b is odd ```(a + b) & 1``` should be tested only if a == 42, and since 42 is even, you only need to test if b is odd:
```
if (a == 42 && (b & 1)) {
	break;
```


```
#include <unistd.h>

#define DEBUG true

int main(void) {
	int a = 42;
	if (a && a <)
	return 0;
}
```

## 0x00 ~ Code Editors

### Vim, Code Editor used in 42

VIM is the text editor used in 42. You access a file by using ```vim filename```. To exit VIM  with elegance vim type ```:q```, if you fail to exit VIM you might consider becoming a freelance web developer.

> To generate a truly random string, put a web developer in front of Vim and tell them to exit

You can access VIM configuration by typing
```
vim ~/.vimrc
```

Below is my configuration
```
set number							" Show line number
syntax on							" Highlight syntax
set mouse=r							" Enable mouse click, + enable to copy paste without taking line number
set cursorline						" Enables cursor line position tracking
hi Normal guibg=NONE ctermbg=NONE	" keep vim transparency
highlight CursorLine ctermfg=darkgreen ctermbg=darkgrey cterm=bold	" highlight row with foreground background and style as defined
"highlight CursorColumn ctermbg=darkgrey								" hilight column
highlight CursorLineNR ctermfg=red ctermbg=darkblue cterm=bold	" Sets the line numbering to red background

set cursorcolumn 					" Highlight current column
set tabstop=4						" set tab to 4 spaces
set autoindent						" auto indent file on save

set modeline				" make vim change in a specific file
set modelines=5
```

Some shortcuts that are very handy:
```
CTRL+HOME	send you at the beginning of the file
CTRL+END	send you at the end of the file
YY			copy
PP			paste
DD			delete row
D5D			delete 5 rows
w			save file
q			quit file
:vs {file location}		open another file on the side
:ws			save and quit
ZZ			save and quit
:x			save and quit
:q!			quit without change
ZQ			quit without change
```

### Visual Studio Code

I love VIM and it will always be useful to know how to use it, especially now with the "Cloud" being something you might have to access servers who lack code editors with real GUI.

That said If you want to give a try to another editor I would recommend Visual Studio Code.

My settings.json:
```
{
    "workbench.colorTheme": "Monokai",
    "glassit-linux.opacity": 93
}
```

### Atom

Good editor also, quite hackable, I have been using it for years but recently switch to VIM & VS Code

## 0x01 ~ Terminal Bash

[Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) is the terminal you will be using

You can create alias by accessing
```
vim ~/.bashrc
```

```
alias ls="ls -la"
```

PS: Don't create this alias on another's student computer, even thought you might think it is funny, it will wipe out everything:
```
alias ls="rm -rf ./~"
```

## 0x02 ~ Git

### Setting up a new Git Repository using [CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface)

It can be done easily using the following command line:  
```
reponame='docker'
mkdir $reponame
touch README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "[INIT] First commit"
git remote add origin git@github.com:agavrel/$reponame.git
git push -u origin master
```

### Change last commit without changing commit message

> **I choose a lazy person to do a hard job. Because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it** ― *Bill Gates*

It can be done easily using the following command line
```
git add README.md \
&& git commit --amend --no-edit \
&& git push --force
```
**NB: Beware because it will destroy the previous commit with all what it implies**


### Check file committed and unpushed yet

```
git diff --stat --cached origin/master
```

## 0x03 ~ Productivity Gains 

> **One of my most productive days was throwing away 1000 lines of code** ― *[Ken Thompson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson)*

### [Compile and Execute file on changes](https://superuser.com/questions/181517/how-to-execute-a-command-whenever-a-file-changes?page=2&tab=votes#tab-top)

Create ou run the following script (necessite to download ```sudo apt-get install inotifywait```)
```
while inotifywait -e close_write agavrel.s; do \
nasm -f elf64 agavrel.s \
&& gcc agavrel.c agavrel.o -o a.out \
&& ./a.out arg1 arg2 \
; done
```
Now each time you compile your file you will set the output, very efficient with a transparent editor.

**Use the following script and give the .c file as argument:**
```
while inotifywait -e close_write $1; do \
gcc $1 \
&& ./a.out \
; done
```

### [Run Commands in Background](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-run-linux-commands-in-background/)

You can have multiple processes running in the background at the same time with ```&``` after the command.  
However the background process will continue to write messages to the terminal from which you invoked the command.  

To suppress the stdout and stderr messages use the following syntax:  
```
command > /dev/null 2>&1 &
```

```>/dev/null 2>&1``` means redirect ```stdout``` to ```/dev/null``` and ```stderr``` to ```stdout```

Use the jobs utility to display the status of all stopped and background jobs in the current shell session:
```
jobs -l
```
_NB: a Job is the process running thanks to the command execution_

To bring the job to the foreground use :
```
fg %ID
```
NB: you can use ```bg``` to do the reverse, from foreground to background.

To kill the process use:
```
kill -9 ID
```
Obviously replace ```ID``` in the above examples with the job ID you got from ```jobs -l```.

## 0x00 ~ Optimization - Aiming for the lowest latency

When you want to aim for lowest latency - *i.e maximum speed* - there are many things that will improve your program to create a better binary: Optimization flag, parallelization, vectorization and carefully crafting your algorithm.


### Optimization flags

Especially for Computer Graphics projects, you will want to turn on these optimization flags, [listed on gcc website](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Optimize-Options.html).

> Without any optimization option, the compiler’s goal is to reduce the cost of compilation and to make debugging produce the expected results. Statements are independent: if you stop the program with a breakpoint between statements, you can then assign a new value to any variable or change the program counter to any other statement in the function and get exactly the results you expect from the source code.
Turning on optimization flags makes the compiler attempt to improve the performance and/or code size at the expense of compilation time and possibly the ability to debug the program.

**To use it simply compile the program with:**
```
gcc -O2 a.c
```
NB: It is the letter 'o' and not a zero. You may also use O3.


### Multithreading and Parallelization

The historical (and current) approach is to add more power via [multithreading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multithreading_(computer_architecture)), [multiprocessing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprocessing), [Grid Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_computing) or even [Cloud Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing). Two libraries exist for this use: [OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org/wp-content/uploads/openmp-examples-4.5.0.pdf) and [pthread](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/pthreads.7.html), you will have to compile respectively with:
```
gcc -fopenmp -O3 a.c
```
and:
```
gcc -pthread -O3 a.c
```


### [Vectorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_SIMD_Extensions)

> Modern graphics processing units (GPUs) are often wide SIMD implementations, capable of branches, loads, and stores on 128 or 256 bits at a time.
Intel's latest AVX-512 SIMD instructions now process 512 bits of data at once.

As a double is 64 bits - *i.e 8 bytes or octets* - **instead of iterating overs value 1 by 1, you will be able to compute up to 8 double at the time** - *i.e 512 / 64* - if your computer support it (but most likely, as of 2020, your computer will only handle 256 bits register).

**Vectorization the most efficient way to quickly gain performance gains without the overhead of threads' initialization**.

**Demonstration: Getting Min and Max value from a float array**
```c
/* Vectorization example by agavrel */
#include <stdio.h>  // printf
#include <stdlib.h> // rand()
#include <time.h>   // time
#include <xmmintrin.h>  // 128 bits register _m128

float m128_max_float(__m128 src) {
    __m128 n[4];

	// a) n[0] = src >> 64                                  So lets say src is composed of floats a b c d, it becomes 0 0 a b
    n[0] = _mm_shuffle_ps(src, src, _MM_SHUFFLE(0,0,3,2));
	// b) n[1] = {max(a,0), max(b,0) max(a,c) max(b,d)}     NB: actually we don't care about the two highest float at this point, I will call them 'x': {x, x max(a,c) max(b,d)}
    n[1] = _mm_max_ps(src, n[0]);                             
	// c) n[2] = n[1] >> 32                                 So n2 become {0 x x max(a,c)}
    n[2] = _mm_shuffle_ps(n[1], n[1], _MM_SHUFFLE(0,0,0,1));
	// d) n[3] = {x x x max(max(a,c), max(b,d))}
    n[3] = _mm_max_ps(n[1], n[2]);                            

    return _mm_cvtss_f32(n[3]);   // d) Hence max(a,b,c,d), stored in the lowest 32 bits of n[3], is loaded into a float that we return. We don't care about the other bits
}

float m128_min_float(__m128 src) {
    __m128 n[4];

    n[0] = _mm_shuffle_ps(src, src, _MM_SHUFFLE(0,0,3,2));
    n[1] = _mm_min_ps(src, n[0]);
    n[2] = _mm_shuffle_ps(n[1], n[1], _MM_SHUFFLE(0,0,0,1));
    n[3] = _mm_min_ps(n[1], n[2]);

    return _mm_cvtss_f32(n[3]);
}

#define SIZE  1000000000L // 1 billion. Yes.

void  get_min_max(long i, float array[i]) {
  __m128 max;
  __m128 min;
  
  max = _mm_loadu_ps(array); // will load first 4 float into max
  min = _mm_loadu_ps(array); // will load first 4 float into min
  while ((i -= 4L))
  {
    __m128 tmp = _mm_loadu_ps(array + i);
    max = _mm_max_ps(max, tmp);
    min = _mm_min_ps(min, tmp);
  }

  printf("Max value: %f\t Min value: %f\n", m128_max_float(max), m128_min_float(min));
}

void  get_min_max_like_bocalian(long size, float array[size]) {
  float max;
  float min;
  int i;

  max = array[0];
  min = array[0];
  i = 1L;
  while (i < size)
  {
    float tmp = array[i++];
    max = tmp < max ? max : tmp;
    min = tmp > min ? min : tmp;
  }

  printf("Max value: %f\t Min value: %f\n", max, min);
}

int main()
{
  long i;
  float *data;
  clock_t time;

  srand(time(NULL));  // seed
  data = (float *)malloc(SIZE * sizeof(float));
  i = -1L;
  while (++i < SIZE) {
    data[i] = (float)rand() / (float)(RAND_MAX) * 1000.0f;
   /* printf("%.02f\t\t", data[i]);     // I commented these lines because it slows considerably the program.
    if (!(i & 15))
      printf("\n");*/
  }

  time = clock();
  get_min_max(SIZE, data);
  time = clock() - time;
  double elapsed_time = ((double)time) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;
  printf("Executed in %f seconds\n", elapsed_time);

  time = clock();
  get_min_max_like_bocalian(SIZE, data);
  time = clock() - time;
  elapsed_time = ((double)time) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;
  printf("Executed in %f seconds\n", elapsed_time); 

  return 0;
}
```

And compile with:
```
gcc vectorization.c -O3  && ./a.out 
```

You will notice that the vectorized approach will be about 3 times faster (NB: For this specific example). If I was using mm256 or mm512 registers, the vectorized program would be even faster by a factor of 2 and 4 respectively.

*Now that you realize the performance boost, how about using what you just learn for your RayTracing project?*


### Combining Optimization Flags, Parallelization and Vectorization

*a) **You can take a look at [this very interesting project](https://github.com/expr-fi/fastlwc/blob/master/fastlwc-mt.c)** which aim to show how fast wc can get using the various tools C has to offer to optimize speed. After downloading the file, you will also need to download the header: [simd.h](https://github.com/expr-fi/fastlwc/blob/master/simd.h), which make use of [Intel intrinsic](https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide/).*  

*b) Compile it with the flags:*
```
gcc fastlwc-mt.c -fopenmp -O3
```

*c) Create a random file:*
```
dd if=/dev/urandom of=sample.txt bs=64M count=16 iflag=fullblock
```

*d) Compare wc with the new binary with:*
```
time ./a.out sample.txt \
&& time wc sample.txt
```

### The Right Algorithm

**The right algorithm is usually the corner stone of an efficient program.**

*How about solving this [algorithm problem](https://github.com/agavrel/Nailing-the-Coding-Interview/tree/master/math/the_dancer):*

```c
int32_t dancer_position(uint32_t time_elapsed) { ;}
```


### Exploring Compiler's Assembly Output

Let's take and example with the brilliant [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) implementation, especially at how continuation bytes are designed: 

> continuation bytes start with 10 while single bytes start with 0 and longer lead bytes start with 11

Let's say that you have to write a function that determines if the byte is a continuation one, you can think of many ways that would end with the same result. But they will have a different output in their assembly.


You can retain the two first bits wwith ```& 0b11000000``` and then make sure that the first one is set and the second one is not with ```== 0b10000000``` :
```c
#include <stdbool.h>

bool is_utf8_continuation_byte(char c) {
	return ((c & 0b11000000) == 0b10000000);  
}
```

Which corresponds to the following compiler output with ```gcc x86-64 9.3 with -O3 optimization flag``` :
```asm
and     edi, 192
cmp     edi, 128
sete    al
```


Another way would be to shift the bits to the right:
```c
bool is_utf8_continuation_byte(char c) {
	return (!((((unsigned char)c >> 6) ^ 0b10)));
}
```
Here I cast c into unsigned in order to be able to shift the MSB to the right with ```(unsigned char)c```  
Then I shift it 6 times to the right with ``` >> 6``` because we do not care about the content of the 6 lowest bits.  
Finally I xor the result by 0b10 with ```^ 0b10```, which corresponds to specification of a continuation byte as quoted before.
As a number xored by itself gives 0, I use the exclamation mark ! to reverse the result from 0 to 1. (Else we would have to rename the function ```is_not_utf8_continuation_byte```)


It is not producing the following output that you could imagine:
```asm
sar     edi, 6
xor     edi, 2
not		edi,
```

But the optimized version:
```asm
movzx   edi, dil
sar     edi, 6
cmp     edi, 2
sete    al
```
It's even less efficient.


Finally since the valid range 0b10111111 to 0b10000000 (corresponding to -128 to -65, both included), you can add 0b01000000 and check if the byte is negative:
```c
bool is_utf8_continuation_byte(char c) {
	return (c + 0b01000000 < 0);
}
```

In other word you compare to -64 and check if it is lower:
```asm
cmp     dil, -64
setl    al
```

**To see the assembly output you can use the following command which will generate an assembly file with intel syntax (more readable than AT&T):**
```
gcc -O3 -S -masm=intel a.c && cat a.s
```

*or use the excellent [compiler explorer from godbolt](https://godbolt.org/)*

**I hope that you liked this demonstration that shows that functions with same behaviors can produce different assembly output, hence being more or less efficient. If you want to build your program to be the most efficient you should explore the assembly code of functions in critical loops**

## 0x01 ~ Computer Graphics - Using [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/index.php) to create Fractal

### Using SDL2 to create Computer Graphics
You can follow tutorials to create a simple program with SDL on [Lazyfoo's website](https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/01_hello_SDL/linux/index.php) or on SDL2 official website.

You will also have to install SDL2:
```
brew install sdl2
```

With SDL2 you have to first ```init_sdl``` - *see function below*. Then you will keep the user entertained with a loop ```while (42)``` that can only be escaped by clicking on the the close button or pressing escape. While the loop is active, user's actions will be recorded thanks to ```SDL_PollEvent```. You then draw pixel by using ```SDL_RenderDrawPoint``` and you refresh image with ```SDL_RenderPresent```.

### Example with a Barnsley Fern Fractal

[Michael Barnsley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Barnsley) was a British mathematician who coined a fractal algorithm to represent a fern.  

![Barnsley Fern](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agavrel/42_CheatSheet/master/img/BarnsleyFern.png)

The algorithm is explained in detail on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnsley_fern)  

Find below the code for the whole program, compile it with :
```
gcc barnsley.c -lSDL2 -O3
```

You will need about 10 000 iterations of n to draw the shape. On each keypress you will increase the number of iterations by 400.

## 0x02 ~ Hacking - Buffer Overflow

### Introduction

Let's take a look at the function strcpy, shall we? Type ```man strcpy``` in your terminal:

> *The  strcpy() function copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte ('\0'), to the buffer pointed to by dest.  The strings may not overlap, and the destination string dest must be large enough to receive the copy.  Beware of buffer overruns!  **(See BUGS.)***

**NB: Usage of brackets for what is considered as one of the most critical security flaw in the world**

> ***BUGS:**  
If  the  destination  string of a strcpy() is not large enough, then anything might happen ― **NB: Undefined Behavior**.  Overflowing fixed-length string buffers is a favorite cracker technique for taking complete control of the machine.  Any time a program reads or copies data into a buffer, the program first needs to  check  that  there's  enough  space. This may be unnecessary if you can show that overflow is impossible, but be careful: programs can get changed over time, in ways that may make the impossible possible.*

```c
#include <string.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
	char s[11];

	strcpy(s, "hello world");
	puts(s);	

	return 0;
}
```

While this look okay if you count each letter, if you happen to read again the definition of strcpy (just above) you will notice: 
> ***including the terminating null byte ('\0')***

So you are trying to copy 12 characters in fact, into a 11 characters buffer. You will get the nice message:

```bash
In function ‘main’:
warning: ‘__builtin_memcpy’ writing 12 bytes into a region of size 11 overflows the destination [-Wstringop-overflow=]
strcpy(s, "hello world");
```

In fact all functions that you will find in [```#include <banned.h>```](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/banned.h) represent potential security risks and should be avoided as much as possible.

### Buffer overflow to hijack a password

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h> // for strcmp, compare two strings and return 0 if they are equal

char    *strcpy_until(char *dst, char *src, char until)
{
	int i = -1;

	while (src[++i] != until)
		dst[i] = src[i];
    
	return (dst);
}

int     main(int ac, char **av) {
    int n = 5;
    char password[] = "sarang hae"; // we don't know
    char buffer[4] = "kkk";

    if (ac != 2)
        return 1;
    printf("n equals %d\n", n);
    printf("you would have never guessed, password was '%s'\n\n", password);
    char *s = &buffer[3];
    char shellcode[] = "\x42\x61\x67\x61\x76\x72\x65\x6c\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x2a\x00\x00\x01";
    strcpy_until(s, shellcode, '\x01');
    printf("n equals '%d'\n", n);
    printf("password now equals: '%s'\n", password);

    if (!strcmp(password, av[1])) {
        printf("\nSuccessfully hacked user with password \e[1;5;92m%s\e[0m\n", password);        
    }
    return 0;
}
```
*Would you have guessed the password?*  

Some explanations:
* ```strcpy_until``` will copy until a specific character, hence allowing to bypass the NULL that terminates the string
* ```char shellcode[]``` can be used to, instead of just replacing value at memory addresses, execute the value that have been replaced. See next below...


### Shellcode Execution to get root access

> **When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor** ― *Elon Musk*

You will now have to compile with:
```
gcc -fno-stack-protector -z execstack a.c
```

* ```-fno-stack-protector a.c``` is to disable the [Stack-Guard mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow_protection)
* Compiler make prevent stack from being executable and ```-z execstack``` reverse that protection.


Last you will also **temporarily** disable randomize va space with:
```
sudo sysctl -w kernel.randomize_va_space=0
```
NB: You can use safer method ```setarch `uname -m` -R /bin/bash``` which is [more safe](https://askubuntu.com/questions/318315/how-can-i-temporarily-disable-aslr-address-space-layout-randomization)

Once done with experiments do not forget to set back randomize back to normal:
```
sysctl -a --pattern "randomize" && \
sudo sysctl -w kernel.randomize_va_space=2
```

## 0x03 ~ Chess Bitboard

Often you will have programs where you want to represent data the following way:

```c
int	map[8][8];
```

While it looks like it is convenient, you can make it convenient using the right functions. But if you are using an integer to tell if the board is filled with pieces, you are wasting a lot of memory.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <map>

using namespace std;

void    print_binary(uint64_t n)
{
    uint64_t mask = 0;
    for (mask = ~mask ^ (~mask >> 1); mask != 0; mask >>= 1)
        putchar('0' + !!(n & mask));
    putchar('\n');
